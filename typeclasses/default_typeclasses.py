DEFAULT TYPECLASSES

Account

The Account represents the game "account" and each login has only one
Account object. An Account is what chats on default channels but has no
other in-game-world existence. Rather the Account puppets Objects (such
as Characters) in order to actually participate in the game world.


Channel

The channel class represents the out-of-character chat-room usable by
Accounts in-game. It is mostly overloaded to change its appearance, but
channels can be used to implement many different forms of message
distribution systems.

Note that sending data to channels are handled via the CMD_CHANNEL
syscommand (see evennia.syscmds). The sending should normally not need
to be modified.


Characters

Characters are (by default) Objects setup to be puppeted by Accounts.
They are what you "see" in game. The Character class in this module
is setup to be the "default" character type created by the default
creation commands.


Exits

Exits are connectors between Rooms. An exit always has a destination property
set and has a single command defined on itself with the same name as its key,
for allowing Characters to traverse the exit to its destination.


Guest

Guest accounts are simple low-level accounts that are created/deleted
on the fly and allows users to test the game without the commitment
of a full registration. Guest accounts are deactivated by default; to
activate them, add the following line to your settings file:

    GUEST_ENABLED = True

You will also need to modify the connection screen to reflect the
possibility to connect with a guest account. The setting file accepts
several more options for customizing the Guest account system.


Object

The Object is the "naked" base class for things in the game world.

Note that the default Character, Room and Exit does not inherit from
this Object, but from their respective default implementations in the
evennia library. If you want to use this class as a parent to change
the other types, you can do so by adding this as a multiple
inheritance.


Room

Rooms are simple containers that has no location of their own.


Scripts

Scripts are powerful jacks-of-all-trades. They have no in-game
existence and can be used to represent persistent game systems in some
circumstances. Scripts can also have a time component that allows them
to "fire" regularly or a limited number of times.

There is generally no "tree" of Scripts inheriting from each other.
Rather, each script tends to inherit from the base Script class and
just overloads its hooks to have it perform its function.

class Account(DefaultAccount):
    """
    This class describes the actual OOC account (i.e. the user connecting
    to the MUD). It does NOT have visual appearance in the game world (that
    is handled by the character which is connected to this). Comm channels
    are attended/joined using this object.

    It can be useful e.g. for storing configuration options for your game, but
    should generally not hold any character-related info (that's best handled
    on the character level).

    Can be set using BASE_ACCOUNT_TYPECLASS.

    Useful hooks:

                from outside the game, like from IRC
        format_message(msg, emit=False) - format the message body before
                displaying it to the user. 'emit' generally means that the

                    and its commands only be called by itself, not anyone else.

                              of the Exit object. Conventionally, a kwarg `force_init`
                              should force a rebuild of the cmdset, this is triggered
                              by the `@alias` command when aliases are changed.

    This is the root typeclass object, implementing an in-game Evennia

    must always inherit from this object (or any of the other objects
    in this file, since they all actually inherit from BaseObject, as
    seen in src.object.objects).

    The BaseObject class implements several hooks tying into the game
    engine. By re-implementing these hooks you can control the
    system. You should never need to re-implement special Python
    methods, such as __init__ and especially never __getattribute__ and
    __setattr__ since these are used heavily by the typeclass system
    of Evennia and messing with them might well break things for you.

     is_valid() - is called to check if the script is valid to be running
                  at the current time. If is_valid() returns False, the running
                  script is stopped and removed from the game. You can use this
                  to check state changes (i.e. an script tracking some combat
                  stats at regular intervals is only valid to run while there is
                  actual combat going on).
      at_start() - Called every time the script is started, which for persistent
                  scripts is at least once every server start. Note that this is
                  unaffected by self.delay_start, which only delays the first
                  call to at_repeat().
      at_repeat() - Called every self.interval seconds. It will be called
                  immediately upon launch unless self.delay_start is True, which
                  will delay the first call of this method by self.interval
                  seconds. If self.interval==0, this method will never
                  be called.
      at_stop() - Called as the script object is stopped and is about to be
                  removed from the game, e.g. because is_valid() returned False.
      at_server_reload() - Called when server reloads. Can be used to
                  save temporary variables you want should survive a reload.
      at_server_shutdown() - called at a full server shutdown.
